# iDAAS-Connect-HL7
iDAAS has several key components that provide many capabilities. iDAAS Connect is intended ONLY
to enable iDAAS connectivity. iDAAS-Connect-HL7 specifically ONLY deals with enabling 
iDAAS to process the healthcare industry standard HL7 based transactions ONLY.
It will process the following HL7 messages (ADT, ORM, ORU, MFN, MDM, PHA, SCH and VXU) 
from any vendor and any version of HL7 v2.

This solution contains three supporting directories. The intent of these artifacts to enable
resources to work locally: <br/>
1. platform-scripts: support running amq, amq-streams (kafka) and doing very specific things with 
Kafka such as: creating/listing and deleting topics needed for this solution
and also building and packaging the solution as well. All the scripts are named to describe their capabilities <br/>
2. platform-testdata: sample transactions to leverage for using the platform. 

## Scenario: Integration 
This repository follows a very common general facility based implementation. The implementation
is of a facility, we have named MCTN for an application we have named MMS. This implementation 
specifically defines one HL7 socket server endpoint per datatype mentioned above.

### Integration Data Flow Steps
 
1. Any external connecting system will use an HL7 client (external to this application) will connect to the specifically defined HL7
Server socket (one socket per datatype) and typically stay connected.
2. The HL7 client will send a single HL7 based transaction to the HL7 server.
3. iDAAS Connect HL7 will do the following actions:<br/>
    a. Receive the HL7 message. Internally, it will audit the data it received to 
    a specifically defined topic.<br/>
    b. The HL7 message will then be processed to a specifically defined topic for this implementation. There is a 
    specific topic pattern -  for the facility and application each data type has a specific topic define for it.
    For example: MCTN_MMS_ADT, MCTN_MMS_ORM, etc. <br/>
    c. An acknowledgement will then be sent back to the hl7 client (this tells the client he can send the next message,
    if the client does not get this in a timely manner it will resend the same message again until he receives an ACK).<br/>
    d. The acknowledgement is also sent to the auditing topic location.<br/>
    
## Builds
This section will cover both local and automated builds.

### Local Builds
Within the code base you can find the local build commands in the /platform-scripts directory
1.  Run the build-solution.sh script
It will run the maven commands to build and then package up the solution. The package will use the usual settings
in the pom.xml file. It pulls the version and concatenates the version to the output jar it builds.
Additionally, there is a copy statement to remove any specific version, so it outputs idaas-connect-hl7.jar

### Automated Builds
Automated Builds are going to be done in Azure Pipelines

## Running

Once built you can run the solution by executing `./platform-scripts/start-solution.sh`. 
The script will startup Kafka and iDAAS server.

Alternatively, if you have a running instance of Kafka, you can start a solution with:
`./platform-scripts/start-solution-with-kafka-brokers.sh --idaas.kafkaBrokers=host1:port1,host2:port2`.
The script will startup iDAAS server.

It is possible to overwrite configuration by:
1. Providing parameters via command line e.g.
`./start-solution.sh --idaas.adtPort=10009`
2. Creating an application.properties next to the idaas-connect-hl7.jar in the target directory
3. Creating a properties file in a custom location `./start-solution.sh --spring.config.location=file:./config/application.properties`

Supported properties include:
```properties
idaas.kafkaBrokers=localhost:9092 #a comma separated list of kafka brokers e.g. host1:port1,host2:port2
#ports to listen for HL7 messages on
idaas.adtPort=10001 
idaas.ormPort=10002
idaas.oruPort=10003
idaas.rdePort=10004
idaas.mfnPort=10005
idaas.mdmPort=10006
idaas.schPort=10007
idaas.vxuPort=10008
```
