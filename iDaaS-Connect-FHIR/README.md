# iDAAS Connect FHIR
iDAAS Connect FHIR capabilities, this solution is intended to enable resources to get up and running quickly while being able to implement an extensive set of FHIR overall capabilities. To get the latest 
FHIR Resource support please go to the Connected Health/iDAAS 
<a href="https://www.connectedhealth-idaas.io/home/SupportedTransactions" target="_blank">
Supported Transactions page</a>. Currently, we support almost 90 FHIR Resources and/or bundles. In order to 
support features like searching a FHIR Server will be required. The iDAAS-Connect-FHIR component 
does fully support integrating to external vendor FHIR server, look in the running section 
below for more details and specifics.  

## Additional Artifacts/Apps/Data
This solution contains three supporting directories. The intent of these artifacts to enable
resources to work locally: <br/>
+ platform-addons: add-ons potentially needed. We include the AMQ-Streams release here just in case its needed. We 
have also included an additional file that has the settings if you are running IBM's FHIR server locally. Lastly, we have
included an export of the workspace we have internally created within <a href="https://insomnia.rest/products/core/" target="_blank">
Insomnia core</a>. The intent is to help by providing an export as a quick start to help. Simply import the server.xml file within the Insomnia-APITesting 
+ platform-scripts: support running kafka, All of these are only intended to try and help developers if they are learning
about AMQ-Streams (Kafka), we have included some base scripts for creating/listing and deleting topics needed for this solution
and also building and packaging the solution as well. All the scripts are named to describe their capabilities. <br/>
+ platform-testdata: sample transactions to leverage for using the platform. We have included FHIR message samples.

## Pre-Requisites
For all iDaaS design patterns it should be assumed that you will either install as part of this effort, or have the following:

1. An existing Kafka (or some flavor of it) up and running. Red Hat currently implements AMQ-Streams based on Apache Kafka; however, we
have implemented iDaaS with numerous Kafka implementations. Please see the following files we have included to try and help: <br/>
[Kafka](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Demos/blob/master/Kafka.md)<br/>
[KafkaWindows](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Demos/blob/master/KafkaWindows.md)<br/>
No matter the platform chosen it is important to know that the Kafka out of the box implementation might require some changes depending
upon your implementation needs. Here are a few we have made to ensure: <br/>
In <kafka>/config/consumer.properties file we will be enhancing the property of auto.offset.reset to earliest. This is intended to enable any new 
system entering the group to read ALL the messages from the start. <br/>
auto.offset.reset=earliest <br/>
2. Some understanding of building, deploying Java artifacts and the commands associated. If using Maven commands then Maven would need to be intalled and runing for the environment you are using. More details about Maven can be found [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)<br/>
3. An internet connection with active internet connectivity, this is to ensure that if any Maven commands are
run and any libraries need to be pulled down they can.<br/>

We also leverage [Kafka Tools](https://kafkatool.com/) to help us show Kafka details and transactions; however, you can leverage
code or various other Kafka technologies ot view the topics.

# Scenario: Integration 
This repository follows a very common general facility based implementation. 

### Integration Data Flow Steps
This data flow is a sample flow based on real world usage and needs. When the iDAAS-Connect-FHIR starts it 
creates a servlet endpoint per defined FHIR Resource
that can be leveraged immediately. To date the iDAAS-Connect-FHIR component fully supports all
the FHIR resource needs for CMS Interoperability Final Rule including support for USCD1.
FHIR Servers and has been tested with multiple FHIR servers.<br/>
<b>How would I connect to iDAAS-Connect-FHIR to post data to it?</b><br/>
<i>Every FHIR supported resource is in lower case.</i> This example is based on the default 
configuration of iDAAS with no advanced configuration or HTTPS endpoints being enabled. For example, 
if the iDAAS-Connect-FHIR 
is running on localhost and you are trying to work with a FHIR Condition resource then 
the URL would be http://localhost/8080/condition.
 
1. We use Insomnia Core, a well know API testing tool, to connect to the specific FHIR resource endpoint within the 
running instance of iDAAS-Connect-FHIR. 
2. iDAAS-Connect-FHIR audits the inbound data.
3. iDAAS-Connect-FHIR then processes the data to/from the configured FHIR server
4. iDAAS-Connect-FHIR then processes the FHIR server response and audits it as well. 
    
# Start The Engine!!!
This section covers the running of the solution. There are several options to start the Engine Up!!!

## Step 1: Kafka Server To Connect To
In order for ANY processing to occur you must have a Kafka server running that this accelerator is configured to connect to.
Please see the following files we have included to try and help: <br/>
[Kafka](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Demos/blob/master/Kafka.md)<br/>
[KafkaWindows](https://github.com/RedHat-Healthcare/iDaaS-Demos/blob/master/KafkaWindows.md)<br/>

## Step 2: Running the App: Maven or Code Editor
This section covers how to get the application started.
+ Maven: go to the directory of where you have this code. Specifically, you want to be at the same level as the POM.xml file and execute the
following command: <br/>
```
mvn clean install
 ```
Depending upon if you have every run this code before and what libraries you have already in your local Maven instance it could take a few minutes.
+ Code Editor: You can right click on the Application.java in the /src/<application namespace> and select Run

### Design Pattern/Accelerator Configuration
Alternatively, if you have a running instance of Kafka, you can start a solution with:
`./platform-scripts/start-solution-with-kafka-brokers.sh --idaas.kafkaBrokers=host1:port1,host2:port2`.
The script will startup iDAAS server.

It is possible to overwrite configuration by:
1. Providing parameters via command line e.g.
2. Leverage the respective application.properties file in the correct location to ensure the properties are properly set
To use with a custom location `./start-solution.sh --spring.config.location=file:./config/application.properties`. However,
if you run from a Java IDE or from any command line that just invokes the jar it will automatically pull the application.properties
file in the resources directory closest to the jar file.

As you look at the properties the idaas.fhirVendor on startup determines the FHIR Server that would be
leveraged:
idaas.fhirVendor=ibm
idaas.fhirVendor=hapi
idaas.fhirVendor=microsoft

Supported properties include:
```
idaas.kafkaBrokers=localhost:9092 #a comma separated list of kafka brokers e.g. host1:port1,host2:port2
idaas.fhirVendor=ibm
idaas.ibmURI=http://localhost:8090/fhir-server/api/v4/
idaas.hapiURI=http://localhost:8080/hapi/api/v4/
idaas.msoftURI=http://localhost:9999/microsoftapi/api/v4/
```

# Testing
We have made a recent change to leverage Insomnia Core for testing APIs.  Leverage the files included in the 
platforms-addons/Insomnia-APITesting directory of this repository.

## FHIR Servers
The platform is all about working with other technologies as needed. Please following the following links for any
specifics to the two leading FHIR Servers we have implemented and tested with: <br/>
